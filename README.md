# 📚 Learning Hub — Technical Mastery

Welcome to my **Learning Hub** — a living repository where I track, organize, and apply my studies across programming, data, hardware, and cybersecurity.

This is **not** a finished portfolio.  
It’s my **workspace**, my sandbox, and my record of progress — designed to grow over time as I move from beginner concepts to advanced mastery.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

1. **Learn systematically** — breaking each subject into focused, achievable milestones.  
2. **Apply knowledge** — through practical, project-based work.  
3. **Document the journey** — with clear notes, structured code, and honest progress tracking.

Every folder corresponds to a **specific book, course, or structured resource**. Each contains:
- A `README.md` with goals, project ideas, and progress.
- My solutions to exercises.
- Original projects inspired by the resource.

Some folders will be **empty placeholders** — waiting for me to get there. That’s by design.

## 🛠 How I Work Here

- **One folder per skill area**  
- **One subfolder per resource** (book, course, workshop)  
- **Code + Notes** in each resource folder  
- **Small projects** after each major concept

---

## 📈 Progress Philosophy

I don’t rush through books or courses.  
Instead:
1. Read / Watch — *understand the concept*  
2. Apply — *build something with it*  
3. Document — *write down what I learned*  

Some topics will advance quickly; others will take months.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is **not** a public portfolio of production-ready apps.  
It’s a **transparent record of my learning journey** — messy in places, clean in others.

If you’re here for collaboration or inspiration — welcome!  
If you’re here expecting a polished final product — check back later.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Continue filling out **empty folders** as I progress.
- Add more **project-based resources** for each skill.
- Evolve this into both a **learning log** and a **showcase**.
